      org.bluez.obex.Client1:
      @short_description: Database to store permissions

      The permission store can be used by portals to store permissions
      that sandboxed applications have to various resources, such as
      files outside the sandbox.

      Since the resources managed by portals can be varied, the permission
      store is fairly free-form: there can be multiple tables; resources are
      identified by an ID, as are applications, and permissions are stored as
      string arrays. None of these strings are interpreted by the permission
      store in any way.

      In addition, the permission store allows to associate extra data
      (in the form of a GVariant) with each resource.

      This document describes version 2 of the permission store interface.
