This file is meant to summarize the Folks development policies.

Code merging
============

This is the work flow for modifying the master repository:

1. File a bug for the given flaw or feature (if it does not already exist) at
   <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=folks>.

2. Clone the main repository (if you haven't already) and start work in a new
   branch (which preferably includes the bug number in its name).

3. If this is a non-trivial flaw or feature, write test cases. We won't accept
   significant changes without adequate test coverage.

4. Write code to fix the flaw or add the feature. In the case that tests are
   necessary, the new tests must pass consistently.
   
5. All code must follow the project coding style (see below).

6. The project must remain buildable with all configure options and pass all
   tests on all platforms.

7. Push your branch to a public repository and attach patch(es) to the bug. Ask
   for a review.

8. Rework your code based on suggestions in the review and submit new patches.
   Return to the review step as necessary.

9. Upon approval, pull the latest master branch, rebase your branch upon it, and
   push the resulting branch to master. Simple!

Clean commits
=============

Commits/patches should be as fine-grained as possible (and no finer). Every
distinct change should be in its own commit and every commit should be a
meaningful change on its own.

As much as possible, the full tree should be buildable and pass all tests at
every commit. There are exceptions, but they're rare. And, of course, it's more
critical that the master branch be buildable (and all tests pass) after every
merge.

Coding style
============

In general, Folks follows the Telepathy-GLib coding style described in
<http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Style>.

Additional general rules
------------------------

1. All public symbols which support a Valadoc comment block must have one. This
   comment block must also be sufficient for gobject-introspection to adequately
   introspect the symbol for use in other programming languages.

2. Include a @since statement in the comment block for new symbols.

Vala-specific rules
-------------------

1. Any functions which could block must be async.

2. Use the language-native Errors for error reporting, not return values.

3. Take advantage of properties and their automatic notify signals as much as
   possible (this eliminates the need for most special accessors, mutators, and
   custom signals and is more conventional).

4. Class function blocks should be indented like GNU/Telepathy-GLib if/while
   blocks. It's arguable that these should be aligned in column 0, as in regular
   C functions, but it's too late to change this (as it would make 'git blame'
   useless).

5. Private and internal class data members should beging with a _ (public data
   members and local variables should not begin with a _). This is to make
   non-public data members instantly recognizable as such (which helps
   readability).

6. Private and internal class functions should begin with a _ (public functions
   should not begin with a _). This is to make non-public functions instantly
   recognizable as such (which helps readability).

7. Maximize use of the 'var' variable type. This shortens the declarations where
   it's valid, reducing noise.

   Rarely, the use of 'var' can obscure the effective type of the variable. In
   this case, it's acceptable to provide an explicit type.

8. Use the 'unowned' modifier when it would prevent a non-trivial amount of
   memory allocation. This is most commonly true for strings, arrays, and
   non-reference-counted variables.

   Do not use 'unowned' for reference-counted variables (like objects) since it
   reduces readability without benefit. And, as of this writing, bgo#638199
   forces unowned variables to have an explicit type (preventing the use of
   'var').

9. As in most languages, avoid casting. Casting is usually a sign of an error
   which should be fixed and reduces readability.

10. Refer to non-local variables and methods with their qualified name. Within a
    class function, refer to private data members like 'this._foo' and foreign
    package symbols like 'package_name.symbol'.

    This makes scope immediately clear, helping readability.

11. Use nullable types correctly. This helps readability (and makes the
    programmer's intentions clearer about whether a variable may be null). The
    ultimate goal is for folks to compile correctly with Vala’s strict-non-null
    mode enabled
    (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Tutorial#Strict_Non-Null_Mode).
    You can compile folks with strict-non-null mode enabled using:
        make VALAFLAGS=--enable-experimental-non-null

12. Place the (private) member variable declaration for a variable which backs a
    property next to the (public) property declaration, rather than at the top
    of the file. This keeps as much of the code pertaining to a property as
    possible in one location.

13. Initialise member variables when declaring them, if possible, rather than in
    a constructor or construct{} block. If it’s not possible to initialise a
    member variable at declaration time (e.g. because its value depends on
    another variable), perform the initialisation in a construct{} block rather
    than a specific constructor. This means that the initialisation doesn’t have
    to be copied between multiple alternate constructors.

14. When iterating over a MultiMap, try to use the map_iterator().
    This is more efficient than iterating over the result of get_keys(),
    then calling get() separately for each key.

Build health
============

1.  Before pushing commits to the mainline branch, the final commit in the
    series must successfully build and pass 'make check' consistently.

2.  After commits have been pushed to mainline, all buildbots must successfully
    build and pass 'make check' on their next build of Folks. It's up to the
    committer to ensure this requirement is met and make necessary changes.

Debugging tests
===============

If a test ever crashes, you'll probably want to run it through gdb. The exact
setup work for that is a bit complicated, so we've provided some convenience
hooks for each test. Simply run:

        make -C tests/<dir> <test name>.gdb

Then use gdb as normal.

To run a single test:
        make -C tests/<dir> check TESTS=<test name>

To run a single test with debugging output:
        make -C tests/<dir> check TESTS=<test name> CHECK_VERBOSE=1

If a test needs to be run through Valgrind for memory debugging, use:
        make -C tests/<dir> check TESTS=<test name> FOLKS_TEST_VALGRIND=1

If a test needs to be run through Callgrind for performance profiling, use:
        make -C tests/<dir> check TESTS=<test name> FOLKS_TEST_CALLGRIND=1

Profiling folks
===============

Folks has various profiling points throughout its startup code, in order to be
able to profile the startup process. In order to use this:
 1. Compile folks with --enable-profiling.
 2. strace -ttt -f -o /tmp/logfile folks-inspect # or some other folks program
 3. python plot-timeline.py -o output.png /tmp/logfile
 4. Examine output.png for obvious problems

This is based on Federico Mena Quintero’s plot-timeline.py, described on:
http://people.gnome.org/~federico/news-2006-03.html#timeline-tools. The Python
script itself can be downloaded from
http://gitorious.org/projects/performance-scripts.

Environment variables
=====================

FOLKS_BACKEND_STORE_KEY_FILE_PATH sets the keyfile used to control the set
of enabled backends. The default is g_get_user_data_dir()/folks/backends.ini,
and if it is empty, all backends are enabled.

If FOLKS_BACKENDS_ALLOWED is set, it's a space-, comma- or
colon-separated list of backends to allow, or "all". If unset, the
default is equivalent to "all". Backends not in the list are disallowed,
even if enabled in the keyfile or with enable_backend().

If FOLKS_BACKENDS_DISABLED is set, it's a space-, comma- or
colon-separated list of backends to disallow, or "all". If unset, the
default is equivalent to "all". Backends in the list are disallowed,
even if enabled in the keyfile or with enable_backend().
