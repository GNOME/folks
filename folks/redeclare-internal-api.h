/* These functions are marked 'internal', which means Vala makes them ABI
 * but omits them from header files.
 *
 * We can't just tell valac to generate an "internal" VAPI and header
 * via -h and --internal-vapi, because the "internal" header redefines
 * things like "typedef struct _FolksPersonaStore FolksPersonaStore"
 * which are an error if redefined; so you can only include the "internal"
 * header or the "public" one, never both. If we use the "internal"
 * VAPI then libfolks-eds' "public" header ends up trying to include
 * the "internal" header of libfolks, which is unacceptable.
 *
 * Redundant declarations of functions and macros, unlike typedefs, are
 * allowed by C as long as they have identical content. We ought to be able
 * to check that these declarations match what Vala is currently generating
 * by including this header when compiling libfolks. Unfortunately,
 * if we do that we can't include <folks/folks.h>, because Vala-generated
 * C code redeclares local Vala-generated types, functions, etc. rather than
 * just including <folks/folks.h>, and then the typedefs conflict.
